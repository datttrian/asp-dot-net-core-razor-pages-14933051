Razor Pages allows you to build ASP.NET web applications quickly and easily without an MVC framework. In this course, instructor Ervis Trupja shows you how to create a Razor Pages application, use the PageModel, and manage dependencies as you go. Find out how to get your first dynamically rendered page up and running before you learn about data binding, working with forms and data, and securing your application with authorization and authentication. Along the way, explore the use of layouts and classes to optimize pages for maintainability and more. Ervis shows you the skills you need to know to get the most out of Razor Pages and set your sights on next-level applications.
